# Checkpoint 1

## Office Space Allocation

### Purpose

The office space allocation apps models a room allocation system. Allocations are made at random and identical data ought to produce  different allocations with each run.

### Implementation

* This app uses the text files in the **data** folder to persist and edit staff and fellow allocation.
* Living and Office space instances each have a constant maximum number of occupants. If an attempt is made to add a person while the space is at capacity, an exception is raised with a message to tell the user that the space is full.
* Living spaces throw an extra exception (TypeError) when an attempt is made to add a staff member to a living space.

### How to use

1. Open Terminal on your computer.
2. Run ```python checkpoint1.py```. The app produces a menu similar to the one below. To select an item, input the number corresponding to the menu you want and press the enter key.

	```
		1. Allocate people to rooms
  		2. Get list of allocations
		3. Print allocation list
		4. List unallocated people
		5. List people in a room

	```
